# Using multi-slot transclusion

## Objectives

- Inject multiple elements into transcluded slots

## Instructions

Using our `UserProfile` directive in this repo, we want to put subheaders before the user information. We've got the name inside our `<h4>`, the position inside our `<h6>` and a short description of the person inside our `<p>`.

Use multi-slot transclusion to put headers before each item (Name before name etc).
